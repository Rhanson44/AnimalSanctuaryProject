# *AnimalSanctuaryProject*

## Project Overview

### Objective: 

Model an animal sanctuary in which animals are cared for by an attendant

### Sub-objectives:

- Define an animal parent class which models behaviors of at least three animal type subclasses
- Apply polymorphism to specialize attributes of each animal subclass
- Construct an attendant class to iterate through an array of animals and perform appropriate actions (e.g. 'Feed', 'Check if empty')
- Create a sanctuary class which can list the animals present, add an animal, and initialize attendant rounds
- Implement a sanctuary app class with a main method to print a menu, allowing the user to call respective methods

### Stretch goals:

- Allow the user to determine the size of the sanctuary
- Add the option to remove an animal
- When an animal is listed, output the name of its class
- When capacity is reached, create a new array of double its size and copy the previous array's contents

## Coding concepts utilized:

- Object Oriented Programming: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
- Calling super class methods and identifying this. objects
- Structual organization via method parameters and arguments
- Define class state and behavior
- Various Java libraries (Scanner, Random)
